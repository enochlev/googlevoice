Authentication
==============

Google Voice no longer supports password login from a script; the modern web
app authenticates with your Google session cookies. You sign in once in a real
browser, and the library reuses the saved session afterwards.

Sign in (once)
--------------

::

    python -m googlevoice.auth login

A Chrome window opens. Sign in to the Google account that owns your Voice
number -- password, 2-step verification, and passkeys all work normally -- and
wait on the inbox. Login is detected automatically and the session is written
to ``~/.googlevoice/session.json``.

Using and moving the session
----------------------------

That ``session.json`` is all the library needs to read your account. It is
**portable**: copy it to a headless server or container and it keeps working
with no browser. Check whether a saved session is still valid with::

    python -m googlevoice.auth check

Re-run ``login`` only if the session is revoked or expires.

.. warning::
   ``session.json`` grants access to your Google Voice account. Keep it
   private (it is created with ``0600`` permissions).

Sending
-------

Reading is browser-free, but **sending** SMS is gated by Google behind
anti-abuse tokens (reCAPTCHA + BotGuard) that can only be produced in a
browser. :class:`googlevoice.browser.BrowserSender` therefore drives the real
web app to send, reusing the signed-in browser profile from ``login``. Sending
thus requires Chrome to be installed on the sending machine.
